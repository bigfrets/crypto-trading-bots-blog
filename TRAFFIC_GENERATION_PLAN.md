Title: "Lost $30K trading crypto manually - here's how bots saved my portfolio"

I'm sharing this because I wish someone had told me earlier...

Started with $50K in crypto trading. 6 months later: $20K left.

My biggest mistakes:
❌ Emotional FOMO trading (-$8,500)
❌ Revenge trading after losses (-$6,200) 
❌ Sleeping through opportunities (-$5,800)
❌ Over-trading fees (-$4,300)
❌ No stop losses (-$5,200)

Then I discovered trading bots. Same $20K, 6 months later: $34,500.

The difference? Bots removed emotions completely.

I wrote a detailed breakdown of my mistakes and how I fixed them: [link to your blog]

Has anyone else had similar experiences with manual vs automated trading?

Title: "Complete guide to crypto trading bots - tested 12 platforms so you don't have to"

🥈 3Commas - Most advanced features ($29/month)
🥉 Cryptohopper - Best backtesting ($19/month)
