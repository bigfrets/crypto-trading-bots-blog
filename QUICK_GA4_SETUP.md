# üöÄ QUICK GA4 SETUP - Get Visitor Tracking in 15 Minutes

## Current Problem: NO VISITOR DATA

Your site has **G-XXXXXXXXXX** (placeholder) instead of real tracking.

**This means you can't see:**

- How many affiliate links were clicked
- Where traffic comes from

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Set Up Google Analytics 4

5. **Click:** "Create stream"

### Step 3: Get Your Tracking ID (1 minute)

After creating the stream, you'll see:
- **Measurement ID** starting with "G-" (example: G-ABC123DEF4)
- **COPY THIS ID** - you need it next!

### Step 4: Update Your Website (2 minutes)

1. **Open:** `hugo.toml` file
2. **Find line 44:** `googleAnalytics = "G-XXXXXXXXXX"`
3. **Replace:** "G-XXXXXXXXXX" with your real ID
4. **Save the file**

### Step 5: Deploy Changes (3 minutes)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add real Google Analytics tracking"
git push origin main
```

Your Netlify site will automatically rebuild with tracking.

1. **Wait 15 minutes** after deployment
2. **Go to:** https://analytics.google.com
3. **Click:** "Realtime" in left sidebar
4. **Visit your site:** https://bestcryptobots.netlify.app

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

3. **Don't ignore real-time testing** - always verify it works
4. **Don't wait to set this up** - you're missing valuable data every day

## üéÅ Bonus: Advanced Tracking (Optional)
